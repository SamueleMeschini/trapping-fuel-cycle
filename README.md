# Tritium trapping in fuel cycles
Fusion fuel cycle simulator developed on MATLAB Simulink. For the ARC fuel cycle layout refer to Meschini, S. et al. "Modeling and analysis of the tritium fuel cycle for ARC- and STEP-Class D-T fusion power plants" - available [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acf3fc/meta). This model includes tritium trapping in plasma facing components and vacuum vessel. 

PLease note that most of the results are provided also as raw data in the csv files. However, a few of them are missing due to their large size.
